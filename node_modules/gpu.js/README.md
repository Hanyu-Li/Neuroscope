gpu.js is a single-file JavaScript library for GPGPU in the browser. gpu.js will automatically compile specially written JavaScript functions into shader language and run them on the GPU using the WebGL API. In the case where WebGL is not available, the functions will still run in regular JavaScript.

# Example

Matrix multiplication written in gpu.js:

```js
const gpu = new GPU();

// Create the GPU accelerated function from a kernel
// function that computes a single element in the
// 512 x 512 matrix (2D array). The kernel function
// is run in a parallel manner in the GPU resulting
// in very fast computations! (...sometimes)
const matMult = gpu.createKernel(function(a, b) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 512; i++) {
        sum += a[this.thread.y][i] * b[i][this.thread.x];
    }
    return sum;
}).dimensions([512, 512]);

// Perform matrix multiplication on 2 matrices of size 512 x 512
const c = matMult(a, b);
```

You can run a benchmark of this [here](http://gpu.rocks). Typically, it will run at 1-15x speedup depending on your hardware.

Or alternatively you can experiment around with the [kernel playground here](http://gpu.rocks/playground/playground.html)

# Getting Started

## Installation
Download the latest version of gpu.js and include the file in your HTML page using the following tags:

```html
<script src="/path/to/js/gpu.min.js"></script>
```

In JavaScript, initialise the library:

```js
const gpu = new GPU();
```

Note that this **requires** the Promise API, if you need to polyfill it, you can give our 'untested polyfill' a try [here](https://github.com/picoded/small_promise.js)

### Creating and Running Functions
Depending on your output type, specify the intended dimensions of your output. You cannot have a accelerated function that does not specify any dimensions.

Dimensions of Output	|	How to specify dimensions
----------------------- |-------------------------------
1D			            |	`[length]`
2D		            	|	`[width, height]`
3D		            	|	`[width, height, depth]`

```js
const opt = {
    dimensions: [100]
};
```

Create the function you want to run on the GPU. The first input parameter to `createKernel` is a kernel function which will compute a single number in the output. The thread identifiers, `this.thread.x`, `this.thread.y` or `this.thread.z` will allow you to specify the appropriate behavior of the kernel function at specific positions of the output.

```js
const myFunc = gpu.createKernel(function() {
    return this.thread.x;
}, opt);
```

The created function is a regular JavaScript function, you can use it like regular functions.

```js
myFunc();
// Result: [0, 1, 2, 3, ... 99]
```

Note: Instead of creating an object, you can use the chainable shortcut methods as a neater way of specificying options.

```js
const myFunc = gpu.createKernel(function() {
    return this.thread.x;
}).dimensions([100]);
    
myFunc();
// Result: [0, 1, 2, 3, ... 99]
```
### Accepting Input

Kernel functions may accept numbers, or 1D, 2D or 3D array of numbers as input. To define an argument, simply add it to the kernel function like regular JavaScript.

```js
const myFunc = gpu.createKernel(function(x) {
    return x;
}).dimensions([100]);
    
myFunc(42);
// Result: [42, 42, 42, 42, ... 42]
```

Similarly, with array inputs:

```js
const myFunc = gpu.createKernel(function(X) {
    return X[this.thread.x % 3];
}).dimensions([100]);
    
myFunc([1, 2, 3]);
// Result: [1, 2, 3, 1, ... 1 ]
```

### Graphical Output

Sometimes, you want to produce a `canvas` image instead of doing numeric computations. To achieve this, set the `graphical` flag to `true` and the output dimensions to `[width, height]`. The thread identifiers will now refer to the `x` and `y` coordinate of the pixel you are producing. Inside your kernel function, use `this.color(r,g,b)` or `this.color(r,g,b,a)` to specify the color of the pixel.

For performance reasons, the return value for your function will no longer be anything useful. Instead, to display the image, retrieve the `canvas` DOM node and insert it into your page.

```js
const render = gpu.createKernel(function() {
    this.color(0, 0, 0, 1);
}).dimensions([20, 20]).graphical(true);
    
render();

const canvas = render.getCanvas();
document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].appendChild(canvas);
```

Note: To animate the rendering, use requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout for optimal performance. For more information, see [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame).
